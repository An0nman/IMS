Ahmed : Currently working on video (https://youtu.be/KE7mv-cwOoo?list=PLglf6-OPbGDfDFpnN67xqvTCR4WxQm4bd)
        1) when ever you start working on the project plz first update your files so you'll get updated code.
           you can use (git pull https://github.com/An0nman/IMS.git main) command on your terminal.
        2) mention your video time too so if a person wants to start working he can continue from there
        3) By the way if someone has time and i am working on the project you can whatsapp me i'll something else so you can work on it.
      Currently all the code doest match the video try to understand it, not all, just the part you need to change.
